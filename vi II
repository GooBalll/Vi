Vi was born in the woodlands of (), part of a small elf tribe which subsisted off the land. You lived in harmony with the world around you and your only dream in life was to protect this peace. 

One day whilst you were out hunting, you heard cries of alarm in the distance. You found a human caravan under attack by orcs. With your skill with the bow, you easily fended off the orc raiding party, but not before many in the caravan were dead or dying.

You took them back to your tribe in the hopes you could save them, and thanks to the care of the village healers, most survived.

Unfortunately, not a week later the orcs came back seeking vengeance, and attacked your village as you slept. Your parents were slaughtered in their sleep. You barely managed to escape the raid.
After many months of travelling you came upon a human settlement, where you hoped your previous kindness would be repaid. You were wrong. The humans were cruel and took no pity on you. After a week of begging on the streets for scraps, work or a simple cot to sleep in, you stole your first coinpurse. You soon became skilled at slicing open bags and stealing precious things. You even learnt how to use your bow silently to punch a hole in a coinpurse and let the gold trickle out.

It didn't take long for the town guard to realise it was you, and chase you out of town. You stole and lied your way from town to town until you arrived in Korvosa. A massive city with a well established thieves guild. It didn't take long for them to find you. 
-Vi was invited to join the thieves guild because you tried to pickpocket a thief with your bow and arrow technique
They took your penchant (affinity) for theft and encouraged you to develop it and hone your skills to the point of perfection. Rising through the ranks, earning gold any way possible, be it stealing, bounties, you name it, Vi would do it. 2. 
-high profile mission for vi
-to steal a expensive exotic instrument called a “guqin” from some high nobility noble. 
-during a stay at a inn in the same town as the mansion of the noble, Vi notices an old man playing a lute but pays him no further attention
-Breaking into the mansion was easy, but after grabbing the guqin, but then seemingly out of the shadows the old musician appears.
-Vi told him to get out of her way, but the old man refused saying that he needed that Guqin.
-Vi rushed him, but the old man tackled her 
???
-The old man knocked Vi out and the next thing she knows she awakens bound to a chair inside a log cabin, she could barely make out that this cabin was inside a forest from small cracks in the logs, as the window was darkened. 
-Vi tries to get herself loose, but the bindings are elaborate and will take some time to get out of. 
-The old man standing in a corner in the shadows assures Vi that she won’t easily get out of those bounds and won’t get very far.
-Vi why keep me alive at all? 
-They become… semi friends?
-The old man explains to Vi why he needs the Guqin, and shows her a secret compartment with in it a special dagger, as the old man explains “This is a blade that can be discreetly extended or retracted from a bracer to make it concealed. This is the preferred weapon of assassins in the guild I was a part of.. long long ago.”
-Vi but if you are no longer a part of this assassin guild, why would you need this hidden blade?
-During my retirement, one of my loved ones was robbed and left to die on the side of the road. I couldn’t even get to her fast enough to hear her last words… *the old man slams his fist into a nearby wall* I decided to find my lost blade for one final assassination, the man who robbed and gained from her death. >insert some name< 
-Vi but he is the >something< of the thieves guild! 

The old man notices people getting closer to the cabin, and knocks out Vi who wanted to help, saying “This is my fight, I will not let you fight your former comrades.” As she faints from this world. 

-The old man gets killed by a group of thieves sent by the guild adjudant(not the master, but the one under that)  

-When Vi awakes and emerges from her forced hiding places, she sees the old man dying on the floor and rushes to him.
-Vi: “but why old man!” 
-Old man: I would not dare to be the cause of the death of another innocent.
-Vi hugs the old man
-Vi “but then why did you train me in your assassin arts!”
-Old man: “I hoped it would assist you in your journey into this chaotic world, and help focus your thoughts instead of rampantly stealing what you could.”

-Old man: “In this cabin in that chest over there, you will find items I hope will assist you through your life, but I hope you will use them for better purposes then mindless killing and stealing.” *the old man reaches to take a necklace off and gives it to Vi. It is a amulet with a Nightingale on it.*

-Old man: “With this amulet, you are now part of my family, the Nightingales. You may call yourself Vi Nightingale and expect assistance from those who recognize the symbol. ”
-The old man dies and Vi closes his eyes after which she picks him up and lies him down on his bed.
Vi walks over to the chest and opens it, in it she finds several things, a concealable thieves kit, a sturdy black armor with hood and mask, the guqin that began it all, a new hidden dagger, and a darkwood long bow with a quiver in which next to normal arrows is a note and one special arrow. 
-The note reads : 
“These are my gifts to you, I hope they will help you well. 
However, as I know how impulsive young people can be, as I myself once was young. 
You will most likely want to avenge my death. I cannot stop you from this, to this end, I let a blacksmith create one special arrow for you. This arrow can be fired from a much longer distance then the bow I gave you normally can, it will seek out its target where it is. 

I had hoped to accomplish the deed myself using the hidden blade, but clearly that is no longer possible. 
Travel far far away from here if you do decided to launch the arrow. 

One final request, You do not need to bury me, burn the cabin instead.
Yours truly, 

the old man”
-Vi to no one in particular “I will let loose one arrow of vengeance for thee” whilst pulling back the string on her bow starting at the sun going down with the cabin on fire in the background. 
You left Korvosa on a ship for Magnemar, and then Sandpoint, where you heard there was an adventurer's guild. 
-During this trip Vi learned to play the Guqin? 
You hope not to slip back into your old habits and to use your skills to better yourself, but then again, the coin purse is right there....
